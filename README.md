# Roast My Resume

We created a platform for users to upload their resumes, cover letters, and outreach messages so that other users can leave comments on what can be improved. We believe this feedback will be useful for individuals looking for their first job in a different industry to ensure that their resumes and messages cover the points and topics necessary for that particular role.
